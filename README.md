## Description

The aim of this project was to create a mobile app for a service company. The concept I chose, is to create an application that is a kind of a portfolio of the carpentry company. The main goal of my work was to build an additional, but also modern form of contact with an interested client. Thanks to the application, the user can learn about all the most important information and contact the company directly.
